In one of the products I work on, we have an Azure queue processor that runs on demand. Sometimes there are failures, which are easy to query in the database that the queue relates to, but there's no notification that tells us when a failure happened. We could of course add notification capability to our queue processor, but let's say we don't really want to make changes to that, or we'd like some way to bundle several query-based notifications together that may or may not be queue-related. What I've sketched out here is the backend of such a notification service. The basics are in place, but you need some kind of cron job service to initiate it.
